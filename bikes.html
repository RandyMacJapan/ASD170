         <p>Mountain bikes are designed to be ridden primarily on pavement for recreation, fitness, and speed. These are the bikes you see 		everywhere from the Tour de France to the group road ride at your local bike shop. Road bike technology has developed at a rapid pace, 		and new bikes are lighter, stronger, more comfortable, and faster than ever before.
 		<em>Beach and Mountain Bikes</em>,
         You can build a private training studio for local athletes.</p>
         <p>All road bikes will perform effectively in a wide variety of riding situations, from racing to long distance touring. But 		each style is designed to emphasize certain rider priorities and be used for a particular type of ride. Determining which style of 		bike fits your goals is the first step in identifying the one that you’ll most enjoy riding.</p>

         <p>If you want a unique bike that stands out from the average mountain bike, a classic beach cruiser
			 is the way to go. With a curvy frame, wide balloon tires, and an arsenal of accessories, a beach cruiser 
			is fun on two wheels.</p>
         <p>To find the right men’s beach cruiser, you first need to look at size. Available with small, medium, and 
			large frames, the appropriate bike size will maximize your comfort as you pedal down the boardwalk. Beyond size, there are several 			different styles to consider, such as the classic cruiser and the chopper. Keep an eye out for smaller accessories such as 			fenders, lights, bells, racks, and baskets that might enhance your ride, too..</p>
